# Handoff Notes (Ant Farm v0.1)

## What’s Done
- Ant Protocol defined (`ant-protocol.md`)
- v0.1 roadmap locked (`roadmap.md`)
- Core API shape defined (`core-api.md`)

## Current Focus
Ant‑Scout v0.1:
- Browser extension sends product data
- Core routes data to Ant‑Scout
- Ant‑Scout returns analysis (no automation)

## What Needs Building Next
- Browser extension UI
- Content script to extract product info
- POST /analyze-product implementation

## What NOT to Build Yet
- Payments
- Multi‑site support
- Multiple ants
- Full autonomy

## Notes
- Core does not scrape websites
- Extension handles data extraction
- Trust and transparency > intelligence
